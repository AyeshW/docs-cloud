    Subscription tiers provide the capability to set the maximum number

    the API Cloud provides 4 tiers **Gold** , **Silver** , **Bronze**
    and **Unlimited.** To change these default tiers or to add a new
    tier follow the below instructions.

        item as "Admin Dashboard" in the drop down list. Click on this
        option which will redirect you to the Admin Dashboard
        application.
    3.  In the Admin dashboard application you will see an option as
        **Subscription Tiers** in the left navigation pane.
    4.  To create a new tier, click Add New Tier, specify the required
        values, and click Save. To edit an existing tier, Select edit,
