    WSO2 Cloud allows you to create multiple organizations under a specific Cloud account if necessary. For instructions on how you can create a new organization under you WSO2 Cloud account, see [Add a new organization](../../learn/cloud-administration/add-new-organization).

This creates your WSO2 Cloud account and opens the WSO2 API Cloud Publisher portal.
