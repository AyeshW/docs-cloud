# Open a Support Ticket

As a WSO2 Cloud customer, you can open a support ticket when you need help with any issue you come across. Any member who has access to a particular organization can sign in to WSO2 API Cloud and go to the support page to raise a support ticket for the specific organization. 


Depending on the nature of your issue, you can either create the ticket as an incident or create it as a query. The following table describes the purpose of each issue type in detail:

<table>
<colgroup> <col/> <col/> <col/> </colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Ticket Type</th><th >Description</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="confluenceTd"> Incident</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"> To get expert assistance on an issue that needs immediate attention because it affects a production system, a system being prepared for production, or a pre-production system used for shared development, testing, or staging.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="confluenceTd"> Query</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">To get help on general questions about WSO2 API Cloud.
<div class="admonition note">
         <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
         <p>The SLA for responding to a query is one business day, but in most cases queries are responded to within hours.</p>
         </div></td></tr></tbody></table>

When you raise a support ticket via the API Cloud support page it would simultaneously create an internal ticket in our support system so that our team can take a look at the issue and get in touch with you immediately depending on the severity of the issue.
