### Get help via a support request 

As a WSO2 Cloud customer, you can go to the [support page](https://identity.cloud.wso2.com/samlsso) and create a support request to get help with any issue you come across. Any member who has access to a particular organization can sign in with credentials to create a support request for the specific organization.

!!! tip
    
    In case the WSO2 Cloud support system is down due to maintenance or any other reason, you can email cloud@wso2.com to raise issues. However, at all other times we recommend that you raise support tickets via the [WSO2 API Cloud support page](https://identity.cloud.wso2.com/samlsso).

When you create a support request, you can specify the Issue Type as an Incident or a Query depending on the nature of your issue. The following table describes the purpose of each issue type in detail:

<table>
<colgroup> <col/> <col/> <col/> </colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Ticket Type</th><th >Description</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="confluenceTd"> Incident</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"> To get expert assistance on an issue that needs immediate attention because it affects a production system, a system being prepared for production, or a pre-production system used for shared development, testing, or staging.<div class="admonition note">
         <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
         <p>You should not use the incident issue type to raise general API Cloud related questions that you need assistance with.</p>
         </div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="confluenceTd"> Query</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">To get help on general questions about WSO2 API Cloud.
<div class="admonition note">
         <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
         <p>The SLA for responding to a query is one business day, but in most cases queries are responded to within hours.</p>
         </div></td></tr></tbody></table>

Once you send a support request via the API Cloud support page, it would simultaneously create an internal ticket in our support system so that our team can take a look at the issue and get in touch with you immediately depending on the severity of the issue.
