# Customize Invitation Emails

WSO2 Cloud enables you to customize the emails sent to users.

You can customize the emails sent to the invited users by adding your
own logo and changing the content in the emails.

The default invitation email sent to users with Admin role includes the WSO2 logo and graphics. If you want to make your ownÂ customizations to the default invitation email,
you can contact WSO2 Cloud Support via a support request.

WSO2 Cloud provides you a one-time link, which will be sent with the
invitation. You can customize the content of the email and choose where
the one-time link should be included. The fields for the roles will be
replaced according to your selection. You can also include your own logo
and graphics to customize the email further.

An example of a customized email is given below:
