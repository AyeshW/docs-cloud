# Get Started with Analytics APIs

You need to have a paid plan to use the analytics REST API.Â  

If you are on a trial account, first you should upgrade to a [preferred pricing plan](https://wso2.com/api-management/cloud/#pricing). 

Once you are on a paid plan and you want to use the analytics REST API, you need to contact us via a support ticket to obtain required tokens to invoke the APIs. When you contact us, we will generate the required tokens and share with you so that you can start using the analytics REST API.

**NOTE**: There is a limitation of 5 API calls per minute for each token.
