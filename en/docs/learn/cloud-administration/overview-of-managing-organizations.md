# Overview of Managing Organizations

When you sign up to WSO2 API Cloud, you will need to set up your WSO2 account by specifying your details. When specifying your details, you need to specify an Organization Name. An Organization Key will be auto-generated for the Organization name you specify.


An organization is an environment that will contain all APIs, apps, members, and other entities associated with it. Whenever you sign in to WSO2 API Cloud, you will need to select the organization you want to sign in to.

Depending on your requirement you can also create multiple organizations under a particular WSO2 Cloud account. For example, if necessary you can create one organization as the development environment and another organization as the production environment under the same WSO2 Cloud account.

Take a look at the following topics for detailed information on how you can manage your organizations.
