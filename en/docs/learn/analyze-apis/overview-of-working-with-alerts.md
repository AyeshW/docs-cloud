# Overview of Working with Alerts

WSO2 API Cloud supports various alert types to monitor API-related
statistics for different purposes. Some of the common scenarios that
require alerts are sudden failure of one or more APIs, sudden
increase in the response time of one or more APIs, a change in the
pattern of API resource access, etc.

The following topics describe the different alert types that WSO2 API
Cloud supports, and also provides details on how you can configure and
subscribe to the alert types that you want to have.
